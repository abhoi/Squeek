# Squeek
A Twitter REST API based iOS Application

This app uses Twitter's Fabric Development Suite to gain authorization to Twitter's API.

The application makes appropriate requests to the concerned API's endpoint.

JSON object data is received and parsed in NSDictionary.

The data is then spruced up into a UITableView with custom UITableViewCells to accomodate for different tweet lengths
and whether or not a tweet contains a photo.
